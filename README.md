# Recipe Converter

You found an awesome recipe you want to take a stab at, but you have a problem: you're only one person, and the recipe serves four! Sure, you could easily calculate the necessary adjustments by hand, but why do that when you can ask a computer to do it for you?

## Usage

Simply enter the recipe's original yield in the appropriate input field, the amount of people you would like the recipe to serve, and the original amounts and items that the recipe calls for. The recipe can be as long or as short as you need it to be. Click the "Convert Your Recipe!" button and watch your adjusted recipe pop up on the right side of the screen!

DISCLAIMER: The conversion won't work if you are trying to use fractions
